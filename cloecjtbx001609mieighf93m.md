## **Define Grafana Alerting**

* Grafana alerting is a feature that allows users to set up and manage alerts based on specific conditions or thresholds within their data. With alerting in Grafana, users can define rules to monitor metrics, query results, or other data sources and receive notifications when certain conditions are met.
    
* Grafana Alerting is available for Grafana OSS, Grafana Enterprise, or Grafana Cloud. With Mimir and Loki alert rules you can run alert expressions closer to your data and at a massive scale, all managed by the Grafana UI you are already familiar with.

## **Key features of Grafana Alerting**

1. Alert Rules: Users define rules or conditions that trigger an alert when met. These rules can be based on thresholds, comparisons, or aggregations of data.
    
2. Multiple Alert States: Alerts can have different states, including OK, Pending, and Alerting. This allows for tracking and acknowledgment of alerts.
    
3. Alert Annotations: Grafana can automatically add annotations to a dashboard when an alert is triggered. These annotations provide context for the alert event and help with debugging or investigation.
    
4. Alert Dashboards: Grafana allows the creation of dedicated dashboards to visualize and monitor the status of alerts and their history.
    
5. Alert Notifications History: Grafana keeps a history of triggered alerts, including their state changes and notifications sent, enabling users to review past alert events.
    
6. Silencing and Muting: Users can silence or mute alerts for a specified period to prevent repeated notifications during planned maintenance or known issues.
