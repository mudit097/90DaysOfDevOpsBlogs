In the fast-paced realm of cloud computing, understanding scaling is a critical skill. It empowers your applications to adapt seamlessly to varying workloads, ensuring they perform optimally while keeping costs in check.

This blog series is your gateway to mastering the art of scaling, starting with fundamental prerequisites, moving on to creating an Auto Scaling Group, and finally, testing your scaling strategies.

By the end of this journey, you‚Äôll be equipped to make your cloud-based applications more resilient and efficient, ready to conquer any workload. So, let‚Äôs dive into the world of scaling and embark on this exciting adventure together!

# **Understanding Scaling**

Scaling is the process of adding or removing resources to match the changing demands of your application. As your application grows, you will need to add more resources to handle the increased load. And as the load decreases, you can remove the extra resources to save costs.

Terraform makes it easy to scale your infrastructure by providing a declarative way to define your resources. You can define the number of resources you need and Terraform will automatically create or destroy the resources as needed.

# **Prerequisites**

Before proceeding, we have to set up AWS Provider, Region, VPC, InternetGateway, Security Group, and RouteTable.

```plaintext
üìÅ terraform/terraform-aws 
    --üìÑ terraform.tf 
    --üìÑ provider.tf 
    --üìÑ vpc.tf
    --üìÑ subnet.tf 
    --üìÑ internetgateway.tf 
    --üìÑ routetable.tf 
    --üìÑ securitygroup.tf
```

1. Create a [`terraform.tf`](http://terraform.tf) file to declare AWS providers required for the system.
    

```plaintext
 terraform {
   required_providers {
     aws = {
       source  = "hashicorp/aws"
       version = "~> 4.0"
     }
   }
 }
```

2\. Create a [`provider.tf`](http://provider.tf) file to specify the AWS region required for instance.

```plaintext
 provider "aws" {
   region = "us-east-1"
 }
```

3\. Create a [`vpc.tf`](http://vpc.tf) file to set up VPC for the ec2 instance.

```plaintext
 resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
   cidr_block       = "10.0.0.0/16"
   tags = {
     Name = "main"
   }
 }
```

4\. Inside [`subnet.tf`](http://subnet.tf) file create 2 public subnets for auto-scaling group.

```plaintext
 resource "aws_subnet" "public_subnet_1a" {
   vpc_id     = aws_vpc.main.id
   cidr_block = "10.0.16.0/20"
   availability_zone = "us-east-1a"
   tags = {
     Name = "public-subnet-1"
   }
 }

 resource "aws_subnet" "public_subnet_1b" {
   vpc_id     = aws_vpc.main.id
   cidr_block = "10.0.32.0/20"
   availability_zone = "us-east-1b"
   tags = {
     Name = "public-subnet-2"
   }
 }
```

5\. Create an [`internetgateway.tf`](http://internetgateway.tf) file to configure the internet gateway.

```plaintext
 resource "aws_internet_gateway" "gw" {
   vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
   tags = {
     Name = "internet-getway"
   }
 }
```

6\. Create a [`routetable.tf`](http://routetable.tf) file for routing public subnet to VPC.

```plaintext
 resource "aws_route_table" "route_table" {
    vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id

    route {
      cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
      gateway_id = aws_internet_gateway.gw.id
    }

    tags = {
      Name = "route_table"
    }
  }

  resource "aws_route_table_association" "public_subnet_association_1a" {
    subnet_id      = aws_subnet.public_subnet_1a.id
    route_table_id = aws_route_table.route_table.id
  }
  resource "aws_route_table_association" "public_subnet_association_1b" {
    subnet_id      = aws_subnet.public_subnet_1b.id
    route_table_id = aws_route_table.route_table.id
  }
```

7\. Create a [`securitygroup.tf`](http://securitygroup.tf) file which will create a security group that allows SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, and egress traffic to the instances.

```plaintext
resource "aws_security_group" "web_server" {
  name_prefix = "web-server-sg"
  vpc_id      =  aws_vpc.main.id


  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
   ingress { 
     from_port   = 443 
     to_port     = 443 
     protocol    = "tcp" 
     cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"] 
   } 

  egress { 
     from_port   = 0 
     to_port     = 0 
     protocol    = "-1" 
     cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"] 
   }
}
```

# **Task 1: Create an Auto Scaling Group**

Auto Scaling Groups are used to automatically add or remove EC2 instances based on the current demand. Follow these steps to create an Auto Scaling Group:

* Now create a [`main.tf`](http://main.tf) file. In your [`main.tf`](http://main.tf) file, add the following code to create an Auto Scaling Group:
    

```plaintext
  resource "aws_launch_configuration" "web_server_as" {
    image_id           = "ami-053b0d53c279acc90"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"
    security_groups = [aws_security_group.web_server.id]

    user_data = <<-EOF
    #!/bin/bash
    sudo apt-get update -y
    sudo apt-get install apache2 -y
    sudo systemctl start apache2
    sudo systemctl enable apache2
    sudo systemctl restart apache2
    sudo chmod 766 /var/www/html/index.html
    sudo echo "<html><body><h1>Welcome to Terraform Scaling.</h1></body></html>" >/var/www/html/index.html    
   EOF
  }

  resource "aws_elb" "web_server_lb"{
     name = "web-server-lb"
     security_groups = [aws_security_group.web_server.id]
     subnets = [aws_subnet.public_subnet_1a.id,aws_subnet.public_subnet_1b.id]
     listener {
      instance_port     = 8000
      instance_protocol = "http"
      lb_port           = 80
      lb_protocol       = "http"
    }
    tags = {
      Name = "terraform-elb"
    }
  }

  resource "aws_autoscaling_group" "web_server_asg" {
    name                 = "web-server-asg"
    launch_configuration = aws_launch_configuration.web_server_as.name
    min_size             = 1
    max_size             = 3
    desired_capacity     = 2
    health_check_type    = "EC2"
    load_balancers       = [aws_elb.web_server_lb.name]
    vpc_zone_identifier  = [aws_subnet.public_subnet_1a.id, aws_subnet.public_subnet_1b.id]
  }
```

* Run `terraform init` command which will initialize and provide all prerequisite plugins.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/0*b9PcUxzgXwBbD-K7 align="left")

* Once Terraform is done with execution two new EC2 instances are created as desired capacity is set to 2.
    

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/0*4WD6yqK3xXCpQc0M align="left")

* You can verify Auto scaling group is created named as ‚Äúweb-server-asg‚Äù in the Auto Scaling Group dashboard.

# **Task 2: Test Scaling**

* Go to the AWS Management Console and select the Auto Scaling Groups service.
    

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/0*4Ca7BFa6jnz8LwBf.png align="left")

* Select the Auto Scaling Group you just created and click on the ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù button.
    

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/0*MZYFHY6MTv52fy6S align="left")

* Increase the ‚ÄúDesired Capacity‚Äù to 3 and click on the ‚ÄúSave‚Äù button.

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/0*YbFwpA2XeLluhEwd align="left")

* Wait a few minutes for the new instances to be launched.
    

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/0*ZuwBzM8Soeg4V3QD align="left")

* Go to the EC2 Instances service and verify that the new instances have been launched.
    

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/0*gXYoLdhwM3goy1cU align="left")

* Decrease the ‚ÄúDesired Capacity‚Äù to 1 and wait a few minutes for the extra instances to be terminated.
