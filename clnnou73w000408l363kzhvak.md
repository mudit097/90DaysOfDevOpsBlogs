Welcome back for creating an Ansible Project using Ansible Playbook. In this blog post, we dive into the world of Ansible projects, exploring how to structure and organize your automation workflows effectively.

Discover best practices for creating Ansible projects that simplify configuration management, application deployment, and system orchestration. Harness the power of Ansible to streamline your infrastructure management and drive efficiency in your IT operations.

# **Deploy a Website üåêusing Ansible Playbook**

* Create 4 EC2 instances. Out of 4, One will be the Ansible Master node and the other 3 are child nodes. Make sure all three child nodes are created with the same key pair as Ansible Master.

* Install Ansible on Ansible Master node only.
    

```plaintext
  # Add ansible repository to your instance
  sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible

  # Update the package
  sudo apt update

  # Install the Ansible
  sudo apt install ansible
```

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/0*9o_Jge4jXmu9PGbC.png align="left")

* Once the installation is complete, you can check the version of Ansible using the following command:
    

```plaintext
  ansible --version
```

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/0*oqdFHBZwaWQV5vSq.png align="left")

* Copy the private key from local to the Host server (Ansible Master) at the /home/ubuntu/.ssh folder location.
    

```plaintext
  sudo scp -i "<pem_key>" <pem_key> <ubuntu@ec2.amazonecom>:/home/ubuntu/.ssh/
```

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*W5dy9nGKGc2i5cuTjxTQuQ.png align="left")

* Once the file is copied to the .ssh directory, change the private key permission rwx to the user only.
    

```plaintext
  chmod 700 flask-server
```

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/0*QQ7fjPRmhstmHTyQ.png align="left")

* Access the inventory file using `sudo cat /etc/ansible/hosts`
    

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*B9WYcLvc6wTuVy5bbY7USw.png align="left")

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*EN9HSEAh8zukMOPWrdXR-Q.png align="left")

* Edit the inventory file and add the list of hosts or servers, add the IP addresses of the servers also add private key file location to use for authentication.
    

```plaintext

  [my-servers]
  server1 ansible_host=<Server1_IPv4_Addr>
  server2 ansible_host=<Server2_IPv4_Addr>
  server3 ansible_host=<Server3_IPv4_Addr>

  [all:vars]
  ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/home/ubuntu/.ssh/flask-server.pem
  ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
  ansible_user=ubuntu
```

Now create a playbook to install Nginx

```plaintext
  -
    name: Install and Start Nginx
    hosts: my-servers
    become: yes

    tasks:
      - name: Update apt
        apt:
           update_cache: yes
      - name: Install Nginx
        apt:
          name: nginx
          state: latest
      - name: Start Nginx
        service: 
           name: nginx
           state: started
           enabled: yes
```

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*e1x-ujnp6ibb8umbjxZW6A.png align="left")

Run the playbook using the ansible-playbook command

```plaintext
  ansible-playbook install_nginx.yml
```

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*Tt4U0_b8b7ILZzGvbjioDQ.png align="left")

Check the status of Nginx on all the child servers.

```plaintext
  ansible all -a "sudo systemctl status nginx"
```

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*ZQ3jGCMCoPpuVRaAfXkGKA.png align="left")

For deploying a static website, Create a new file index.html and add the file path in the playbook directory, and add some sample content in the index file.

```plaintext
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Mudit Mathur - DevOps Engineer</title>
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            background-color: #F6F6F6;
            color: #333;
            text-align: center;
            margin: 0;
            padding: 0;
        }

        h1 {
            color: #007BFF;
        }

        p {
            margin: 20px;
        }

        a {
            color: #007BFF;
            text-decoration: none;
        }

        a:hover {
            text-decoration: underline;
        }

Update the Ansible playbook file by providing the index.html file path and destination will be the default NGINX web page, install\_nginx.yml, in the playbook directory:

```plaintext
  -
     name: Install and Start Nginx
     hosts: my-servers
     become: yes
